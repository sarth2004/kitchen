            <p>A slice of classic cheese pizza is one of life's greatest pleasures. 
                While calling for delivery is always a treat, being able to make your own
                 pizza recipes at home is even more satisfying. This recipe covers the basics:
                  kneading a simple dough, stretching it into a round, and cranking up your 
                  oven to get that perfect char. The tasty reward is a crispy-bottomed, airy crust topped with tangy tomato sauce, and milky mozzarella.</p>

            <p>A burger is a patty of ground beef grilled and placed between two halves of a bun. Slices of raw onion, lettuce, bacon, mayonnaise, and other ingredients add flavor. Burgers are considered an American food but are popular around the world. In Japan, teriyaki burgers are popular.</p>
