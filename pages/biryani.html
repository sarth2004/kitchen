<p>Dum Biryani, a culinary masterpiece, tantalizes the senses with its aromatic blend of spices and tender meat or vegetables, layered with fragrant long-grain basmati rice. Originating from the royal kitchens of the Mughals in India, this dish is a testament to the art of slow cooking. Each grain of rice absorbs the essence of saffron, cardamom, cloves, and other spices, while the meat becomes succulent and infused with flavors through the gentle process of dum cooking, where the dish is sealed with dough and slow-cooked over low heat.</p>
